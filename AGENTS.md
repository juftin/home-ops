This is the [juftin/home-ops](https://github.com/juftin/home-ops) repository. This project
defines a GitOps-driven Kubernetes cluster hosted on bare metal. The cluster
is designed to run various applications and services, including home automation
and media management tools.

This repository was created from an upstream template:
[onedr0p/cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template). The template
provides a structured starting point for setting up a Kubernetes cluster with GitOps
principles, allowing for easy management and deployment of applications and services.

Apart from the underlying template, this project is heavily influenced by the
onedr0p/home-ops](https://github.com/onedr0p/home-ops) repository where the creator
has expanded on the template with additional applications and components.

## README.md

The [README.md](README.md) file provides an overview of the project, including
key components, infrastructure details, and a list of applications and services.

## Adding New Components and Apps

When adding new components or applications to the cluster, examining the
[onedr0p/home-ops](https://github.com/onedr0p/home-ops) repository can provide
valuable insights and examples. [kubesearch.dev](https://kubesearch.dev/)
is also a great resource for finding Kubernetes manifests and configurations
for various applications.
